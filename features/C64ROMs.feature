Feature: C64 ROM tests

  This checks the ROM addition syntax

  Scenario: Simple code test for C64 ROMs
    Given a new C64 video display
    And show C64 video window
    Given I have a simple overclocked 6502 system
    Given I am using C64 processor port options
    Given a ROM from file "..\..\VICE\C64\kernal" at $e000
    Given a ROM from file "..\..\VICE\C64\basic" at $a000
    Given a CHARGEN ROM from file "..\..\VICE\C64\chargen"
    Given add C64 hardware

    And render a C64 video display frame


#    And I enable trace with indent
    # This gets to repeatedly checking the keyboard buffer: E5CD  A5 C6     LDA $C6
    When I execute the indirect procedure at $fffc until return or until PC = $E5CF
    And C64 video display saves debug BMP images to leaf filename "target/frames/TC-12-"
    Then render a C64 video display frame
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CD
    Then render a C64 video display frame

    # Using: https://sta.c64.org/cbm64pet.html
    # Run
    Then I write memory at $c6 with 1
    Then I write memory at $277 with $52
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CF
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CD

    Then I write memory at $c6 with 1
    Then I write memory at $277 with $55
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CF
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CD

    Then I write memory at $c6 with 1
    Then I write memory at $277 with $4e
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CF
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CD

    Then I write memory at $c6 with 1
    Then I write memory at $277 with $0d
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CF
    Then I continue executing the procedure until return or until PC = $E5CD

    # Check for "run" and "ready." in screen memory
    Then render a C64 video display frame
    When I hex dump memory between $400 and $800
    Then property "test.BDD6502.lastHexDump" must contain string "4f0: 12 15 0e 20"
    Then property "test.BDD6502.lastHexDump" must contain string "540: 12 05 01 04 19 2e 20"

    # Debug test
#    Given I enable trace with indent
    Given add C64 display window to C64 keyboard buffer hook
    Given add C64 regular IRQ trigger of "100000" cycles
#    Then I continue executing the procedure until return

    # Now explicitly check the various processor port expected behaviours
