Feature: Tests the video character screen data conversion and sprites

  Uses ImageToBitplane config: oldbridge char screen
  >>> Use ImageToBitplane config to improve clouds conversion as it priortises their colours: oldbridge char screen with rgbfactor
  Use ImageToBitplane config to add use of colour 0, since if it is the back most layer then then it can use all 8 colours in the character block: oldbridge char screen with rgbfactor no force colour 0
  Or uses ImageToBitplane config: map_9 - Copy - chars.png char screen
