Added: Given I am using C64 processor port options
	This stops writes to the IO registers from going to RAM



* Add emulated BombJack display
	https://github.com/martinpiper/BombJack/blob/master/README.md
	Sprites notes
		0x = far left visible screen pixel
		Done 0y = 16x16 Top of the sprite just below the bottom edge of the visible screen
		Done 0y = 32x32 Middle horizontal part of the sprite just below the bottom edge of the visible screen
	Add 32x32 sprites 9a00-9a01 (largeSprite)
		Done - Check the hardware for how the inclusive register really works with regards to using sprite update slots
			0-3	 No 32x32

			Does it skip the next sprite?
				Yes
			What about the odd numbers sprites for the ranges?
				No, not the lines into 5R 5S
		Also the sprite frame, does it multiply the sprite frame to ensure it is aligned?
			Yes, it multiplies by 4
			What is the sprite layout?
				01
				23
	Do sprites off the far right appear on the left?
		Yes
	Do sprites off the bottom appear on the top?
		No.
	Done - Add full height mode (fullHeightSprite)



* Emulated hardware display
	When allocating layers, make the address and addressEx configurable
	TODO: Address configs for addressEx=0x01 need to respect the INRAMSEL1 groups 0x8000 0x8800 0x9000 0x9800 ... 0xb800 as these used for selection on each board
		Video board uses fixed address, not configurable.

		
		
* To correctly handle the "lo ENABLEPIXELS (with no border flags)" at 0x189H
	And to handle the hardware plane shifting, which introduces an 8 pixel delay
	The tiles and chars need to latch the Y position at the start of their reads for each tile/char 8 pixel span
	* Sprites also needed this fix, actually it was the sprite span pixel read and clear that gave the hint about the latch
	* See: latchedDisplayV
	* The mode7 layer does not have this problem because it maintains its own pixel clocks from hsync and vsync



* Continue adding syntax to support the other video layers
	features\TestVideoHardware.feature



* Detect when the 24 bit bus is held with an address for an extended number of cycles without data being written
	No need now, the hardware automatically resets the bus a while after the byte is written if another write has not been started



* displayBombJack.isVsyncTriggered
	The $dd0d value is reading the logic level of vsync in the display, it technically doesn't need the reset logic
	However the vsync wait will need a wait for "not vync" if a wait for vsync is issued too quickly after the first wait



* Optional syntax to limit the speed to XX FPS for video display


* Add arrows+ctrl as joystick1 ($dc00) for the video display window



* Output the software bus writes so that the Proteus simulator can use. Will need to detect waits for vsync or log x/y pos for writes



* Using target/debugData.txt the real hardware isn't displaying the high mode7 characters?
	* Mode7Regs2Size and Mode7Regs3Size are wrong, causing strange memory overwrites
	* Verified, by filling map.bin, that tile $02 and $22 are actually rendered
	* The palette used in the tile was the same as the background colour, so it was "invisible".
	* However the palette was being written strangely by the contention test code

	
	
* Twiddle the mode7 HV flips to align them with tiles



* The java video hardware test mode output debug file does not quite render correctly on the hardware
	The raster bars and perspective mode7 part is alternating every frame. Probably something to do with the output displayV not quite catching up properly
	Investigate if the "w$ff01ff00,$ff019000" is not being caught correctly
	It seems waiting for the last line and trying to do all the updates it not working out timing wise
		Removing the wait for line $ff and moving the sprite update to just after the vsync wait worked
	* TODO: Investigate, do we want to want for -ve _VSYNC or -ve VBLANK as it is currently going into the digital data simulator?
		Look at when the better, earlier, timing is just off the bottom of the screen
			VBLANK is better
		* The BDD6502 emulation will need to align the wait to vsync or vblank of course, to match with what the simulator does
	* _VBLANK checking aligned with simulation and emulation

	
	
* Extract memory bus interface for future expansion



* Add audio expansion prototype
	First single channel sound is working at the correct sample rate
	Multiple channel is also working
	* Attempt to convert a small mod/xm
		http://www.retrospekt.com.au/2020/05/tiny-music-a-massive-curated-collection-of-music-in-mod-xm-s3m-other-formats/
		https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yyxyrkin9uj76ie/AABYa381WWs8KXwsIIYo4_q7a?dl=0
		Need to find an up to 8 channel file that will fit within 64K for samples (without down sampling)
		Without too many complex voice controls would also help
		Potential music:

* AudioExpansion could probably do with a loop address and loop length to be used after the first values
	Could use a flip-flop to hold the state, which is reset when high length is written. This obviously adds complexity though.



* Add kMusicCommandDefineSample with index, then remove duplicate sample data from kMusicCommandPlayNote
	Currently: "C:\Users\Martin Piper\Downloads\asikwp_-_twistmachine.mod"
		3 m 20s in 127,487 bytes
		After writing common sample data with kMusicCommandSetSampleData: 61,766 bytes

		
		
* Added audio hardware syntax and test code
	The MemoryBus architecture is also expansion aware.



* Continue MusicPoll with jsr DecompressMusic_GetNextByte
	Process the music events kMusicCommandWaitFrames etc



* Find out why when running from jar the video display slows down.
	It's almost like not enough pixels get calculated?
	* Print the number of instructions elapsed per video display frame
	Hmm Oracle java is slowing down, but this java does not: "C:\Users\Martin Piper\.jdks\corretto-1.8.0_252\bin\java.exe"
		https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/faqs/ is better performance than Oracle java
		Oracle java sucks
			1>Rendered FPS = 48 frameDelta = 535 period=1001 instructionsThisPeriod=610032 instructionsPerFrame=10157 instructionsShortfall=2515
			instructionsThisPeriod=610032
			number of emulated 6502 instructions in 1001 milliseconds
			so .6 MHz
		same jar with Corretto java:
			1>Rendered FPS = 60 frameDelta = 1 period=1001 instructionsThisPeriod=3463955 instructionsPerFrame=57674 instructionsShortfall=-45002
			5.6 times faster
	* QuickDrawPanel::fastSetRGB() created to optimise image drawing further, this is to fix slowdown when using Oracle java compared to the much faster Corretto



* Output raw sample bytes for debug playback and comparison with the hardware
	e.g. "C:\Users\Martin Piper\Downloads\ffmpeg-20200422-2e38c63-win64-static\ffmpeg-20200422-2e38c63-win64-static\bin\ffplay.exe" -f u8 -channels 2 -ar 25000 c:\work\C64\VideoHardware\target\debugchannel.pcmu8
	e.g. "C:\Users\Martin Piper\Downloads\ffmpeg-20200422-2e38c63-win64-static\ffmpeg-20200422-2e38c63-win64-static\bin\ffplay.exe" -f u8 -channels 2 -ar 25000 C:\Work\BDD6502\target\debugchannel.pcmu8



* Emulation will need to match hardware design which now has stereo output



* Force plane ordering, including a plane that is configured to output a specific pixel colour (to emulate poking wires into the header)
	* Tile layer background pixel transparency check. Layer should use specific plane.




* In the hardware simulation: If the sprites layer is the last layer, the sprite's x position seems to update the colour information for the whole vertical strip
	This makes sense since the full height sprite flag has consistent colour and comes from the colour read.
	The bit planes shifters wil be emitting zeros since they will not load the sprite data based on the vertical position test.
	The emulation needs to be updated to reflect this. Currently the emulation does not write colour inforation if the sprite vertical portion is out of range.



* Full height sprites with 32x32 mode enabled, should not display repeated 32x32 sprite data chunks, they should show 32x16 sprite data
	According to the simulation from bus data output by features\TestVideoHardware Chars Sprites.feature



* spriteIndexReJig is used to adjust the sprite reading schedule to that of the hardware



* Chars V4.0 emulation update to match schematic



* Emulate C64 timer to allow the video clock (12.096M) to drive the timer clocks
	A use case is where the C64 sets a timer to count the vertical raster position after the vsync signal is detected
		Pixel clock = 12.096M / 2 = 6048000 Hz
		The line length is 384 pixels, which gives 15750 Hz or 0.063492063492063 ms or 6.349206349206349e-5 seconds
		C64 CyclesPerSecondPALC64	= 985248 Hz
			Which means 985248 (clocks per second) / 15750 (line length from video) = 62.56 clocks per line
	* Added Video_StartRasterTimers
		* Easiest route will be to have a faked timer for the emulation that is setup to provide values like those in the hardware, but ignores the C64 CIA timer code setup values



* Moved display enable/border/priority registers to video generation logic



* Handle 16 colour mode for new hardware revision



* Adding an APU means "a user port to 24 bit bus is installed" and "a new audio expansion" will need to cooperate since it's possible the APU drive the sound board
	This means all display/audio layers will need to get their memory from the APU, not the user port
	* The audio and display layer syntax can be re-ordered to be after the user port and APU syntax
	* com.bdd6502.DisplayBombJack.calculatePixel will need a callback to an optional APU



* Tidy up all the "gotByte & 0xff" rubbish. Make it an accessor that returns an int ready for registers to use



* APU: Debug display, configurable via syntax (and property) to display
	Instruction hex, binary flags, text flags
	PC, registers, and small memory dump for the various address registers




* de.quippy.javamod.multimedia.mod.ModMixer.fastExport add option to scale the samples (and their frequencies) to fit them into a target memory size (like 64K)
	Will need a lower sample threshold size to avoid shrinking "chip sound" samples
	de.quippy.javamod.multimedia.mod.mixer.BasicModMixer.exportSample
	The sample scaling factor can also be calculated in here since exportSample() is called before the first usage of this sample
		Then kMusicCommandPlayNote can include the scaling factor



* Improved music data compression with intensive searching
* com.bdd6502.CompressData add option to search for the best "bestLen > 6" value to use, since there can be better savings when using a longer threshold.



* Syntax for "add a Chars V4.0 layer" needs to include scrolling registers, tests will need to use new data. Create a larger source image for this and create new output data.
	Old small screen image conversion: oldbridge char screen with rgbfactor
	TODO: Need to emulate the bad char definition reads with certain scroll values




* Various music conversion command lines. File from https://modarchive.org/ :
	* Volume only? Not for this tune

		* Fixed: The "aktMemo.newInstrumentSet = true;" needed to be inside the "element.getInstrument()>0" check. Doh!
	java -Dmusic.volume=1 -jar target\BDD6502-1.0.9-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar --exportmod "C:\Users\Martin Piper\Downloads\speedbal.mod" "target/exportedMusic" 65535 151832
	* Volume only? SotB fixed by kMusicCommandAdjustVolume. But it does cause large files and lots of clicking. Needs a better "instrument active" check before it can be used.

* Added music conversion detection of frequency change, which vastly improves playback



* Music conversion, just volume change detection needed?



* Merge event and channel
	Channel low nybble
	Event high nybble



* Excessive clicking when starting a voice fixed. Funnily enough this wasn't in the hardware, but was a fault of the emulation
	Validated in hardware and emulation



* Music conversion: "C:\Users\Martin Piper\Downloads\SOTB_Musiques_Amiga\SOTB - TITLE.mod"
	For some reason it isn't exporting even though this does play:
		java -cp "C:\Users\Martin Piper\Downloads\javamod.jar" de.quippy.javamod.main.CommandLine "C:\Users\Martin Piper\Downloads\SOTB_Musiques_Amiga\SOTB - TITLE.mod"



* Not needed, since layer order register is included in V5.0
	* To use the VideoHardware debug output, the hardware last two layers need to be swapped.
		Perhaps add a switch selector for different layer priorities into the layer select to allow runtime configuration?
		Extra (but disabled and not placed) logic has been added to the video layer




* Remove System.getProp* usage inside time critical routines



* Create 6502 remote debug TCP interface. Enough for the VICEPDBMonitor to work.
    When enable remote debugging
    And wait for debugger connection
    And wait for debugger command


* Improved remote debug single stepping



* Added APU register remote debug output, if it's enabled



* Remote debugger commands like next / step / return do not need to wait for the textual reply before completing the command
	The replies happen when the CPU next stops when sendDebuggerUpdate is true




* kAPU_SkipIfEQ needs to check the data select is stable from the previous cycle to ensure the logic operates on a stable value



* Need kAPU_InternalMEWR in BDD6502



* Add remote debugger single step option for APU
	Perhaps a command to switch between 6510 CPU and APU for the debugger next/step/etc commands
	Code reorganised "handleSuspendLoop(remoteDebugger , RemoteDebugger.kDeviceFlags_CPU);" to allow kDeviceFlags_CPU and kDeviceFlags_APU to suspend execution
	* This will allow the APU to have "step out" to run until the next matching waitHV
	* "Step over" and "step in" are basically the same as there are no JSR equivalent instructions
	Note in the glue code "remoteDebugger.isCurrentDevice(RemoteDebugger.kDeviceFlags_CPU)", using kDeviceFlags_APU will let the APU detect when a command is intended for it instead of the CPU
	Commands to switch APU and 6510:
		cpu apu
		cpu 6502




* Reset frame catch up times while debugging
  Disable sound output



* While debugging with steps have the option of clearing the screen data from the current pixel position to show the newly rendered data in the display
	Or highlight the current position in the window with the previous frame data
	Or clear the entire display data
	Done - Hitting the next step (or break) force redraws the window, basically



* When disassembling, or dumping, take into account the current device and provide APU information when needed
	Done APU disassembly
	Done: Disassembly address in APU mode needs to use the APU PC, not the 6502 PC
		Note the "before address" fetched can be smaller that for 6502
		Also the source disassembly can use the label APUData_Start as an offset if it is available. Filter by the label's zone when in APU mode?
			Allow an optional offset in the debugger to support multiple chunks of APU code as source, or filter by the label's zone?




* displayV changes in simulation at displayH=0x180
	* This is also at MSB displayH, of course
	* Fix emulation to reflect this (it changes at 0x188 currently)
		* Look for "//        if (displayH == 0x180) {"
	* Fix Sprite2 logic
	* However, another issue is that at 0x180 the real hardware displays the last eight pixels of the previous line...
	* Schematic will need a compatator for 0x188, could make it a latch in the register space and variable with a comparator...
	* Could also use a configurable "use start line" value for the span draw. This would be useful for shifting the horizontal "origin" of the screen
	* Done: If the write pixel logic does the same kind of transparency test as the regular sprites (read, test, then optional write / re-write value) this would allow the highest priority sprites to be drawn first and avoid dropout issues better...

* @TC-9 created for 32x32 behaviour



* @TC-1: When using "enable APU mode" and "enable user port bus debug output" the debug output needs to include valid "wait for" information so that it can be fully tested with the APU hardware
	This "wait for" information should be the same as "enable video display bus debug output" and the APU hardware output should roughly match what is observed from "enable video display bus debug output"
	The APU hardware output can then be used with the video rendering
	* This mostly works, however at the moment the data from data writes done in the feature file are not fully captured in the user port debug: VideoHardware\target\debugDataJustUserPort.txt
	Data up to the first d$9e0001** with enable display bit $20 set will be captured in VideoHardware\target\debugData.txt
		This is up to the first w$ or ^-$01 in that file
	* So copy the whole chunk from there to the start of debugDataJustUserPort.txt, replacing everything up to the first w$ or ^-$01
		Then use debugDataJustUserPort.txt in the APU simulation
	* Then for the file BombJack\output\DebugAPUOutput.txt
		The initial waits before  d$9e0001** with enable display bit $20 will need to be changed from "w$" to ";w$"
		Then DebugAPUOutput.txt should be able to be used in the video simulation to check APU generated output
	* At the moment the video simulation with APU output seems to be roughly OK, but some of the waits seem to be missed?
		Replacing all "w$ff03ff00" with "w$ff01ff00" to ignore the _VIDCLK seems to make most (not all) frames better
		Also making the DigitalData generator use a faster clock rate helps
		* This is most likely due to some waits appearing just before the last data write is completed




* @TC-11: Vector display layer
	8K for colour, 8K for scan length
	Two banks of this for displayed and back buffer screen
	Will need a bank selection register
	Low vsync resets the pixel count, pixel, address
	Low display enable behaves like vsync
	Each new line reads the colour and scan length pair in parallel, the pixel clock counts down for the scan length byte before reading a new pixel/length pair.
	End of line -ve _hsync edge increments the read address
	Or if the inverted length (read into the counter) increments when it reaches zero will trigger a read address increment
		And new length read
		And pixel colour latch
	This gives a maximum theoretical scan complexity of 36 segments per scan, assuming 224 scans
	The existing C64 VectorBitmap demo that calculates scans could be used for this



* Vector layer: Storing palette/length pairs needs to be in sequence $0000-$3fff or $8000-$bfff, but stored in the RAMs alternately to allow the parallel read




* @TC-11-000433.bmp
	3D rendering almost works, but there seems to be some weird scan corruptions
	Also seeing: com.loomcom.symon.exceptions.MemoryAccessException: uninitialised memory read: 2D75  F5 19     SBC $19,X      [$00]@$0033 A:39 X:1A Y:19 F:25 S:1F3 [..-..I.C]    SBC Poly2D_vertexBufferX
	Poly2D_loadVertsIntoRegs: sbc Poly2D_vertexBufferX, x
	x should b 0-3 at this point
	** Will need to enable: I enable trace with indent




* Add automatic guard memory ranges that assert when read / write / execute operations happens
	These can be read from label pairs that add buffer memory space
	A macro can be used, the same label names sorted by their memory addresses represent the address pairs
	Syntax to submit label/address pairs




* APU Source debugging works, however the APU instructions are all implemented as macros, so the macro source is shown. Doh. :)
	ACME will need to be improved to output the debug source hierarchy in the PDB, i.e. which file include which file
	Or ACME parses APU code directly without macros
	Then AddrInfo can be updated to include the source file levels after the primary level...
	** Or have the option of reporting the parent in the PDB after encountering a ! pseudo op. The PO would basically say "output the level above this macro" for the lifetime of the macro
	!previouscontext added to ACME



* Fix sprites2 alignment (shift 2 pixels to the right) in emulation to match simulation and reduce calculation by 2 extra clocks



* Add sprites2 clock speed selection in emulation



* For if (pixelsSinceLastDebugWrite >= pixelsSinceLastDebugWriteMax)
	This test is actually bugged as it outputs something like:
		w$ff03ff00,$72004800
		d$980f01f8
		d$9e0a010f
	This does not reflect accurately the position to actually wait for when writing...
	Need to debug "APU_ProcessSpriteStrip" and double check the enable is done 16 pixels after the sprite register updates...
	The the simulation can be fixed if needed. But data indicates that actually it should be OK.



* Layer combiner for pixel output: com.bdd6502.DisplayBombJack.addLayer
	Add a pixel combiner for two inputs to one combined output. This will be useful for the SF2 demo which uses two sprites planes
	Copy from @TC-8
	Hardware wise the layer enable signal from the pixel header would need to be split to the two input pixel headers



* InitWindow uses the correct window size to reflect the screen display aspect ratio



* Sprites2: Add debugger output to show the used scan time for each line of calculated sprites2
	* Best place to add that is: debuggerUpdateRegs
	^^ Done



* Removed voicesLoopMask since the Audio 9.3 hardware assumes loops are always enabled now



* Updated non-looped samples to always use the first exported sample 0x80 byte



* Syntax to randomly initialise data in all connected devices and memory
	Given randomly initialise all memory using seed 4321



* Added Audio layer debug in the register view, if it's enabled



* APU disassembly seems to ignore locations 0-$10 during the SotB demo?
	(Previous fix)



* Break on address
	Done - CPU: receivedBreakAt
	Done - Add "delete"/"del" command to remove address breakpoints



* BDD6502 needs to output compatible break response...
	Also "break" might need to show a list with index values like Vice...
	"delete" also
	break 300
		BREAK: 2  C:$0300  (Stop on exec)




* Add cartridge support
	Read CRT files and store their banks and addresses into a map for easy lookup
	Add syntax to optionally configure cartridge bank address, whether it is read enabled
	Add syntax to specify combinatorial logic (use the variable resolution code ) on multiple locations and enable/disable carts banks, kernal/BASIC ROMs etc
		This can also support bank sizes by mapping cart banks with addresses
	Obviously more than one rule and multiple ROM binary or CRT files can be specified allowing complex cart bank/ROM arrangements to be created
		EF3 and GMod2 need support
			com.loomcom.symon.Bus.write processorPort theProcessorPort
				Detect theProcessorPort changes
					features/C64ROMs.feature
					Given a CRT from file "some\file"
						Will implicitly enable processor port. Note: IO Write detected:
							Done: theProcessorPort needs $17 on reset to emulate the C64
						Note: C:\work\c64\stdlib\stdlib.a lines 19-35
						Done: However the precise CRT support will need early hooks into Bus read and write
							But must only access the cart when ProcessorPortDefault or ProcessorPortCharROMBASICKERNAL
							Or for EF3 EASYFLASH_CONTROL_ULTIMAX mode (the default) where the kernal is mapped from the cart
								EASYFLASH_CONTROL_8K is used very early if most of my startup code
								>> Just assume EASYFLASH_CONTROL_8K?
						Then the scenario can start the CPU at the intended vector address
					Note these will be needed in the scenario, but don't need code updates:
						Given a ROM from file "..\..\VICE\C64\kernal" at $e000
						Given a ROM from file "..\..\VICE\C64\basic" at $a000
						Given add C64 hardware
							Adds devices to cover $d000 - $dfff
					Done: Will need expansion to match the processor port config
						>> com.loomcom.symon.Bus.buildDeviceAddressArray can have an array of deviceAddressArrayWrite and deviceAddressArrayRead indexed by the lower three bits of the processor port
							Bus read and write will need different behaviour as writes go to the underlying RAM
								file:///C:/work/C64Docs/unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/memcfg.htm
							And will automatically map in devices with $a000 $d000 $d800 $e000 addresses
					* Need to test bank switching behaviour. Create a function that stores known data when it's called from ROM.



* To aid debugging hardware, displaying the pixel palette index and RGB colour under the mouse cursor hovering over the screen would be very useful
	Also which layer it came from
	Can be optional syntax since it will probably have a performance impact
	Set the title with details?
	com.bdd6502.DisplayBombJack.calculatePixel will need to store extra details
	Just before some calls to com.bdd6502.QuickDrawPanel.fastSetRGB
	com.bdd6502.DisplayBombJack.RepaintWindow to do the update




* APU: Hardware test seems to show the APU will run its code and even the multiplex sprites and raster bars will work
	But not in the CPU sending data to the APU (or externally?) interrupts APU processing
	The more data sent to the APU the higher the chance the APU will hang
	This indicates the bus arbitration is not functioning properly
		>> Not entirely a surprise since the memory timing could have short pulses etc. These short pulses happen because the internal bus cut-off (going into RAM U17 APU data) and switch over can happen at any point
	** This needs more testing with some simpler example code. Perhaps some raster bars and the CPU not sending any new memory updates either to the APU or the external bus...
	* If no workaround can be found, perhaps an alternative design for the bus arbitration
		>> Workaround was found (see this commit APUAvoidRasters and APUAvoidRastersTable) however it is slow, so not suitable
		For the internal bus writes (from the CPU) rely on the fact that they are relatively slow and store the last 24 bit address and data into temporary latches
		>> Done: Instruction and data selection (writes) no longer reset (retry) the APU instruction
			The temporary latch writes can use the _IMEWR (IEMEMWRITE)
			The register storage for _RESET and ENABLEAPU must still use original IEBS IEA IED and _IMEWR
			The internal RAMs the BUSCHOICE must now use the external EBBS EA ED and _MEWR
				This would theoretically mean the APU self write its internal memory using external writes, which is OK, but not ideal. Still use the internal write flag.
			Using a new 1-of-4 to output to EBS EA ED and _MEWR _MERE (as before):
			** When the APU is RESET/disabled then existing write timings from the userport interface are used
			** Only when the APU is active are new write timings used
				If _RAMSWITCHTOPASSTHROUGH = 0 then use the original IEBS IEA IED IEMEMWRITE IEMEMREAD
				If _RAMSWITCHTOPASSTHROUGH = 1 and InterceptBus = 1 then use RINT IDATA _ExternalMEWRPulse
				If _RAMSWITCHTOPASSTHROUGH = 1 and InterceptBus = 0 then use latched values logic:
					USECACHE and the eventual new generated write pulse are created from a counter and demuxers (like the API instruction)
					If the latched EBBS (TLIEBS) is not 0 (indicating something is needed)
						At the start of the APU instruction then:
							Pause the instruction (not retry it) when trying to increment the PC and the current instruction is not trying to do any internal or external writes (which prioritises APU writes):
								PCINCR = 0
								and not InternalMEWR
								and not InterceptBus
							Execute the latched write by using the new 1-of-4 paths: Create a USECACHE and new write pulse (per above note for USECACHE)
								>> Update NoLatchedWrite on +ve PCINCR
							>> Needs _LATCHEDWRITEPulse
							Clear the latched data (end of the generated write cycle) using a new input into _FLUSHCACHE, which allows the APU to continue instructions
						This is a fully delayed and cooperative internal/external bus write model instead
							>> This would actually remove the need for any instruction retries.
		* Debugging notes
			During reset and disabled period, instruction and data writes work
			** Latched writes "b$11,b$12,b$13,b$14,b$15,b$16,b$17" are unreliable
				When writing $4102 $13
				Oh bother, it's because the APU instruction is waiting for a HV position
				Still unreliable, but $4100 $11 didn't write
				Break on LatchedWriteDesired
					Debug data clock reverted back to 1M
					>> There needs to be some logic that reads LatchedWriteProceed if it's waiting
						InstrIsWaiting = 1 when instruction is waiting
					$4100 $11 didn't write because its write happens while the previous cached write is being written
						PCINCR = 0.8 MHZ so data clock back to 500KHz
		Done: Remember to enable tree movement and remove the APUAvoidRastersTable code...
			; For MAPUAvoidRastersTest: Define out the next line to simply remove the avoid rasters code
			; For MAPUAvoidRastersTest: Comment out the next line to simply remove the table creation
			; For MAPUAvoidRastersTest: Comment out the next line to simply remove the test
		* Done: Check the _MEWR timings and address setup timings are balanced, for (all in ns):
												Same write period		Bus			Write time		Pre			Post
			A5 _RAMSWITCHTOPASSTHROUGH = 0		2000 (500KHz)			395			120				155			120
			A3 InterceptBus = 1					1650					580			182				202			195
			A4 LatchedWriteActive = 1			2230					512			160				225			132	(not centred)
		Done:
		* Need to reconcile data and images for @Demo6 output with emulation and simulated APU
			See: "* For APU validation when running @Demo6:"
		* Update emulation: When InstrIsWaiting check (debug break/error) that there are no InternalMEWR InterceptBus operations in the previous or current instruction
			Also any userport writes must now be delayed, to emulate the latched memory write behaviour including delays for any InternalMEWR/InterceptBus and no delays while HV wait
			Also there are a couple of extra cycles if the APU has to pause while a latched write happens
		* Final feature file validation
		* Replace 6116SA20TPGI with https://www.mouser.sg/ProductDetail/Renesas-Electronics/6116LA20TPG?qs=SmUuHNCnblrwZH5u1F5zAw%3D%3D
		* Layout group and packages
		* Check for merged devices
		* The emulation data output debugData.txt works. There are no reconciliation errors with simulated APU.
				But using the APU simulated output DebugAPUOutput.txt generates some problematic video issues and some memory writes seem to be wrong.
					This looks like a timing issue to do with the simulated APU output using more frequent waits?
					>> Part of the problem was the next HV wait being too soon, so the data gen was missing the event.
						This was most obvious by the screen not rendering raster bar effects for part of the display period
						This was fixed in the data generator where if the next wait event happens during a write it will be processed
					Some update issues remain with the APU simulated data, but not from the emulated output. Most likely also timing based.
						>> Check the Sprites2 writes, since their first frame is not correct
							Recon is fine...
							Try disabling the waits for Sprites2 memory and visually check

								So the new APU must be missing it...
								Need a breakpoint on attempting to write that value...
								Found the issue, the positive edge on USECLK meant that sometimes USECACHE was very short and basically skipped
									This meant the value was not cached and caused missing writes
									Capture for output\DebugAPUOutput.txt has "ignore zero writes" enabled, which made it harder to spot
									Adding an extra USECLK input for the latch set worked. This gives adequate time from the negative edge to the next positive edge to signal USECACHE

		TODO:
			Test place and route

						Needed some planes created, layer pairs, and design rules signals to layers.



* When there is a screen refresh any picked pixel information is refreshed



* Enable/disable pixel picking with 'P' on the keyboard



* Hmm I wonder if I can profile 6502 code by counting cycles for every jsr until its corresponding rts...
	Some monitor commands to:
		profile start
		profile stop
		profile print
		profile reset
	* I will want to note the interrupt status when doing the jsr and only count cycles while it maintains the same status.
		* And handle rti and obviously the kernal vectors
	* This method provides a live view, partially through a subroutine. It is expensive:
		* Whenever a jsr is encountered add it to a map.
		* Each cycle accumulates the count in all listed jsr, with the correct status flag.
		* When it has a corresponding rts, remove the map entry while noting the accumulated cycle count. Add the total for that jsr to the jsr's address map.
	* This method has less performance impact:
		* Whenever a jsr is encountered add it to a map with the current cycle count.
		* When it has a corresponding rts, remove the map entry while noting the cycle count delta. Add the total for that jsr to the jsr's address map.
	* When printing:
		Print the address, label, total cycles



* Add syntax to start/stop/print/test profiled code
    Given profile start
    Given profile clear
    Given profile stop
    Given profile print
    Then property "test.BDD6502.lastProfile" must contain string " : Video_WaitVBlank : "



* Add APU write wait indicator in debug
	<<Wait RAM>> will be seen in the APU debug output if the external (user port or APU) memory write causes data to pass through or to the APU
